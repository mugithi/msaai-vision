### Introduction 
Brain tumors, whether benign or malignant, necessitate accurate and timely identification for effective medical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, offering detailed visualization of internal brain structures, have emerged as indispensable tools for detecting abnormalities

### Project 

This project envision a two stage machine learning pipepline that 1) Classifies whether a tumor exists type of tumor and 2) Detects the areas in the image where there is cancerous brain tissue.
