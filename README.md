### Introduction 
Brain tumors, whether benign or malignant, necessitate accurate and timely identification for effective medical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, offering detailed visualization of internal brain structures, have emerged as indispensable tools for detecting abnormalities

### Project 

This project envisions a two-stage machine learning pipeline for brain tumor analysis. Stage 1: Tumor classification (presence/type). Stage 2: Cancerous tissue localization within the scan.
